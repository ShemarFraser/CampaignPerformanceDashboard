# Campaign-Performance-Dashboard

## Overview
This project involved the development of an interactive dashboard designed to help marketing professionals track, analyze, and optimize the performance of their campaigns. The dashboard, built using Power BI, visualized key metrics such as impressions, clicks, leads, orders, and revenue over a 30-day period, providing real-time insights into campaign effectiveness. Excel was used for in-depth data analysis, enabling the team to explore trends, identify areas of improvement, and make data-driven decisions. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as ROI, CPM, CPC, CTR, Conversion Rate, and Cost per Action were integrated to evaluate campaign performance and inform future strategies. The dashboard provided marketing teams with actionable insights that supported the optimization of ongoing campaigns and the planning of more effective future marketing efforts.
